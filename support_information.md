## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does ClearSound work?
ClearSound automatically detects when you're using Bluetooth headphones and switches your Mac to use the built-in microphone or a custom microphone for input while keeping your headphones for audio output. This eliminates the robotic voice quality caused by Bluetooth bandwidth limitations.

### Why do I sound robotic with AirPods on Mac?
Bluetooth has bandwidth limitations. When both microphone input and audio output use Bluetooth simultaneously, the audio quality degrades significantly, causing that "robotic" or "choppy" sound. ClearSound solves this by using your Mac's high-quality built-in microphone instead.

### Does ClearSound work with all video calling apps?
Yes! ClearSound works system-wide with all Mac applications including Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Discord, Skype, FaceTime, Google Meet, and any other app that uses your Mac's audio system.

### Can I still use my AirPods microphone if needed?
Absolutely! ClearSound provides easy controls in the menu bar. You can quickly switch between your Mac's built-in microphone and your AirPods microphone whenever you need to. You can also set preferences for specific devices.

### Does ClearSound collect any personal data?
No. ClearSound is privacy-first and does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data. All audio processing happens locally on your Mac, and your privacy is completely protected.

### Audio quality is still poor

4. Try disconnecting and reconnecting your Bluetooth headphones
